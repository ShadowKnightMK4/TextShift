TextShift.exe [Arguments]

	Transform and convert text between encodings. Arguments are NOT case sensitive. -Source is the same
as -SoUrCe and so on. Additional '-' or '/' will work to mark arguments, this means -Source is the 
same as /Source. Some commands have a shortened version. For example -S is the same as /Source. 

/?
/HELP
	This displays this file.

-S "SourceFile"
-SOURCE  "SourceFile"

	This command specifies a source to get text from. The file must exist and the user this program
is running under must have access to the file. If either of these cases aren't true, the app exists.


-T  "TargetFile"
-TARGET "TargetFile"

	This commands specifies a target to send the processed text too. The target must exist and the usr 
must also have access to the file. The app quits if these cases aren't true.

-TC
-TARGET:CON
