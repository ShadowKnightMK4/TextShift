The liscense for this is modifed from the MIT template liscense. I wish peuple to be able to use and combine
the sofware as they wish, provided credit is received as a source from this as long as the final result is not
passed off as the original 'TextShift' and the software it is combined with stays free.

There's a note in the liscense that keeps the door open should sometime want to combine this into something they 
want to sell.  This means a seperate agreement.
